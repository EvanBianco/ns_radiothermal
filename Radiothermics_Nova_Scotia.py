# ## Heat flow estimation from aerial radiometric measurements.
# 
# In this notebook we are concerned with the image processing of radiometric maps from Nova Scotia https://novascotia.ca/natr/meb/download/dp163.asp and the subsequent estimate of heat flow following the equations in Beamish and Busby (2016).
# 
# ### About the data
# 
# This data set consists of 7 JPEG images of radiometric data for the province of Nova Scotia. They include images showing Potassium (K, %), equivalent Thorium (eTh, ppm), equivalent Uranium (eU, ppm), the ratio Thorium/Potassium (eTh/K, ppm/%), the ratio Uranium/Potassium (eU/K, ppm/%), the ratio Uranium/Thorium (eU/eTh) and the Total Count at a 50m resolution. The images were created by combining radiometrics data provided by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) from their surveys flown at 1 km line-spacing across the entire province, and 7 detailed surveys flown at 250 m line spacing by the GSC in the following areas: East Kemptville, Liscomb, Ship Harbor, Gibraltor Hill, Granite Lake, Big Indian Lake, and Tantallon Lake. The images were produced by contractor M. S. King using funds provided under the Natural Resources Canada and Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources joint project 'Mapping, Mineral and Energy Resource Evaluation, Central Nova Scotia', part of Natural Resources Canada's Targeted Geoscience Initiative (TGI-2) 2003-2005.
# 
# ### Image processing
# 
# Unfortunately there are two problems with the data as delivered. The first is the images have had a hillshading effect applied obscuring data values from a pure radiometric measurement. The second issue is the images don't have a colorscale, so it's impossible to convert the colours back into physical quantities without using some external heuristic or calibration. 
# 
# We deal with the first issue by converting the R,G,B channels in the image to H, S, V, and then dripping the V channel â€“ which is where the hillshade effect lies. This is following the code from Matt Hall in a Gist called, Ripping data from pseudocolour images:

If the colourmap matches all or part of the colour wheel or hue circle,
